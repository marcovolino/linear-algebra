title: Introduction to Linear Algebra
---

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, vector spaces (linear spaces), and linear transformations. 
Linear algebra is a powerful and essential tool for modeling and solving a wide range of problems in science and engineering, including:

- **Computer Graphics**: Linear algebra is used to model and transform graphical objects, perform rotations, scaling, and other transformations in 2D and 3D spaces.
- **Engineering**: It's used to solve systems of equations that model physical systems, such as electrical circuits, structural analysis, and control systems.
- **Data Science and Machine Learning**: Many algorithms in machine learning, like regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA), rely heavily on linear algebra.
- **Physics**: It is fundamental in the formulation of physical theories, such as quantum mechanics, where states and operators are expressed using vectors and matrices.
- **Economics**: Linear algebra is used to model economic systems, especially when dealing with multiple variables and constraints, like in input-output models.
